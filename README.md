# cljs-dm-client

This is a [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame) application intended to be a web app that manages a D&D campaign.

The API code is located at [go-dm-api](https://github.com/foilofbob/go-dm-api)

## Getting Started


### Editor/IDE

Use your preferred editor or IDE that supports Clojure/ClojureScript development. See
[Clojure tools](https://clojure.org/community/resources#_clojure_tools) for some popular options, I used IntelliJ.

### Environment Setup

1. Install [JDK 8 or later](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) (Java Development Kit)
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (JavaScript runtime environment) which should include
   [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) or if your Node.js installation does not include NPM also install it.
5. Clone this repo and open a terminal in the `cljs-dm-client` project root directory

## Development

### Running the App

Start a temporary local web server, build the app with the `dev` profile, and serve the app,
browser test runner and karma test runner with hot reload:

```sh
npm install
npx shadow-cljs watch app
```

Additionally this app uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for CSS, so to get that watching you'll need to run:

```sh
npx sass --watch resources/scss/main.scss:resources/public/css/main.css
```

When `[:app] Build completed` appears in the output, browse to
[http://localhost:8280/](http://localhost:8280/).

[`shadow-cljs`](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) will automatically push ClojureScript code
changes to your browser on save. To prevent a few common issues, see
[Hot Reload in ClojureScript: Things to avoid](https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2019/08/25/hot-reload-in-clojurescript.html#things-to-avoid).

Opening the app in your browser starts a
[ClojureScript browser REPL](https://clojurescript.org/reference/repl#using-the-browser-as-an-evaluation-environment),
to which you may now connect.

#### Connecting to the browser REPL from your editor

See
[Shadow CLJS User's Guide: Editor Integration](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_editor_integration).
Note that `npm run watch` runs `npx shadow-cljs watch` for you, and that this project's running build ids is
`app`, `browser-test`, `karma-test`, or the keywords `:app`, `:browser-test`, `:karma-test` in a Clojure context.

Alternatively, search the web for info on connecting to a `shadow-cljs` ClojureScript browser REPL
from your editor and configuration.

For example, in Vim / Neovim with `fireplace.vim`
1. Open a `.cljs` file in the project to activate `fireplace.vim`
2. In normal mode, execute the `Piggieback` command with this project's running build id, `:app`:
    ```vim
    :Piggieback :app
    ```

#### Connecting to the browser REPL from a terminal

1. Connect to the `shadow-cljs` nREPL:
    ```sh
    lein repl :connect localhost:8777
    ```
    The REPL prompt, `shadow.user=>`, indicates that is a Clojure REPL, not ClojureScript.

2. In the REPL, switch the session to this project's running build id, `:app`:
    ```clj
    (shadow.cljs.devtools.api/nrepl-select :app)
    ```
    The REPL prompt changes to `cljs.user=>`, indicating that this is now a ClojureScript REPL.
3. See [`user.cljs`](dev/cljs/user.cljs) for symbols that are immediately accessible in the REPL
without needing to `require`.

### Debug Logging

The `debug?` variable in [`config.cljs`](src/cljs/cljs_dm_client/config.cljs) defaults to `true` in
[`dev`](#running-the-app) builds, and `false` in [`prod`](#production) builds.

Use `debug?` for logging or other tasks that should run only on `dev` builds:

```clj
(ns cljs-dm-client.example
  (:require [cljs-dm-client.config :as config])

(when config/debug?
  (println "This message will appear in the browser console only on dev builds."))
```

## Production

Build the app with the `prod` profile:

```sh
npm install
npm run release
```

The `resources/public/js/compiled` directory is created, containing the compiled `app.js` and
`manifest.edn` files.
